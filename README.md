XcodeReorg
==========

An OS-X-FUSE-based file system to help keep Xcode projects in sync with the file system while you reorganize the on-disk structure of your project.

**DOES NOT WORK** In its current state, this is barely useful except for the most trivial case of moving files out of the root directory of the project and into subdirectories.

See TODO.md for ideas on how to improve things.
